# Discord Music Bot
### built using Node.js


## About
This is your typical discord music bot where you can specify the YouTube link or the name of the YouTube video you want to play in discord. What's special about it is that you can specify a certain genre ( jazz, rock or rap ) and it will play a random song in that genre. This has helped me find several songs that are currently my favourites.
